onsubmit event | submit event
				
Occurs on a form element when the user clicks on a submit button in the form.
The onsubmit event is commonly used to validate the contents of form controls 
and set the contents of some input:hidden elements before submitting. If the 
user forgot to fill some required fields or made some other mistake on the form, 
you can cancel the submission with the onsubmit event. 

The event object is accessible to all event handlers in all browsers. The 
properties of the event object contain additional information about the current event. 
To get further details about these properties and the possible event handler 
registration methods, please see the page for the event object.

For a complete list of events, see the page for Events in JavaScript.
